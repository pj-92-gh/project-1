# Abstract

In this notebook, I will be analyzing several climate change data originally taken from the following Kaggle competition:

https://www.kaggle.com/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data

This dataset is maintained by the Berkeley Earth Foundation. The website can be found here:

The datasets that we will be working with are as follows:

City Land Temperatures
State Land Temperatures
Global Temperatures by Country

These datasets contained information related to land temperatures that were taken over several years. In this project, I will only be focusing data taken after 1900. 

The major question we will be looking at here is the following:

Is there an increase in land temperature over time? And if so - can we visualize both the rate of change as well as the absolute change in temperature over time? 

# Conclusions

US State Temps ARE Increasing
US City Temps ARE Increasing
World Temps ARE Increasing

The Rate of Change IS Increasing for Some States

A Linear Relationship DOES NOT Fit Our Trends...Is it Exponential? Further Study Needed!
